Hi there! I am Snehal Raj, a CIFRE PhD Student at LIP6/CNRS - Sorbonne University and [QC Ware](https://www.qcware.com/), under [Prof. Elham Kashefi](https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=P1427) (academic supervisor) & [Dr. Brian Coyle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zDZuloYAAAAJ&hl=en) (industry supervisor).

My thesis explores: *How can we theoretically study and empirically validate quantum & quantum-inspired algorithms that bridge quantum and classical machine learning?*

I graduated from the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) in 2022 with a Master's in Advanced Computer Science. My thesis on improving simulations for Google's supremacy circuits was supervised by [Prof. Aleks Kissinger](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/) and is available [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/theses/raj-thesis.pdf).

Before that, I was at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering. I worked on Quantum Query Complexity as part of my [bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/SnehalRaj/CS396A/blob/master/Report.pdf) and was supervised by [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/).

In a past life, I was affiliated with [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) working on [LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.798/).
