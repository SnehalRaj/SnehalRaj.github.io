Hi there! I am Snehal Raj, a PhD Student at LIP6/CNRS - Sorbonne University - under [Prof. Elham Kashefi](https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=P1427) and an Associate Staff Scientist at [QC Ware](https://www.qcware.com/).

 I graduated from the University of Oxford in 2022 with a Master's in Advanced Computer Science. My thesis was supervised by [Prof. Aleks Kissinger](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/) and is available [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/aleks.kissinger/theses/raj-thesis.pdf).
 
  Before that, I was at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering.
